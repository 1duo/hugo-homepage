I'm a Deep Learning Software Engineer at an Artificial Intelligence startup [NovuMind Inc](http://www.novumind.com/). Before, I was a Software Engineer at [IBM Watson and Cloud Platform](https://www.ibm.com/
) worked on [IBM® Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) and [SoftLayer®](http://www.softlayer.com/).

I worked as Graduate Student Researcher in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/) at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), focused on Parallel Computing and [GPU Graph Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01170).

I also did my Summer Research Internships at [DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)](https://www.darpa.mil/). I was very fortunate to be advised by Professor [John D. Owens](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/). My master's thesis can be found [HERE](/thesis.pdf).
